# Gocard

Web-app for sharing and using spaced repetition flash cards.

## Features / Roadmap

* Easy to share decks/cards
* Decks can be added partially, and the parts can be activated/deactivated
  whenever
* Decks can have a description, similar to a README on Github. They can have
  external links to the subject/book/course they are about.
* An API that allows other apps to integrate the decks in, for example, video
  courses
